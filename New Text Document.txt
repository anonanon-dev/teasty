It sounds like you're encountering a permission issue when trying to push to a remote Git repository. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. Check Your Git Remote URL
Ensure that you are pushing to the correct repository URL. You can verify the remote URL with the following command:

sh
Copy code
git remote -v
If the URL is incorrect or you need to switch between HTTPS and SSH, update it with:

sh
Copy code
git remote set-url origin <new-url>
2. Verify Your Credentials
For HTTPS:
If you’re using HTTPS, ensure you are using the correct credentials. If you have recently changed your password or if your repository is private, you may need to update your credentials.

You can clear cached credentials and re-enter them when prompted:

sh
Copy code
git credential-cache exit
For SSH:
If you’re using SSH, make sure you have your SSH key properly set up and added to your SSH agent. You can check for existing keys with:

sh
Copy code
ls ~/.ssh
If you don’t have an SSH key or need to generate a new one, follow these steps:

Generate a New SSH Key:

sh
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent:

sh
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:

Copy the key to your clipboard:

sh
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Then, go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key, and paste the key there.

3. Check Repository Permissions
Ensure that your GitHub user account has the necessary permissions to push to the repository. If you’re collaborating on a repository, make sure you’ve been granted write access. You might need to contact the repository administrator to get the appropriate permissions.

4. Test Your Connection
If using SSH, test your connection with:

sh
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..." If not, check your SSH setup.

5. Review Git Configuration
Make sure your Git configuration is correct. Check your global Git configuration with:

sh
Copy code
git config --global --list
Ensure the user name and email are set correctly:

sh
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
6. Try Re-authenticating
If you’re still having issues, try re-authenticating or logging out and back into your Git service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, let me know any additional error messages or context, and I can help troubleshoot further!

It looks like you've pasted your SSH public key. To use it for accessing your Git repository, you’ll need to add it to your GitHub account. Here’s a quick guide to make sure everything is set up correctly:

1. Add Your SSH Key to GitHub
Copy Your SSH Public Key:

If you haven’t already, copy your public key to your clipboard:

sh
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Make sure it looks like the key you posted, but with your actual email address.

Log in to GitHub:

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

Navigate to SSH Key Settings:

Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select Settings.
In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
Add a New SSH Key:

Click the New SSH key button.
In the Title field, you can give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "My Laptop" or "Work Machine").
Paste your public key into the Key field.
Click Add SSH key to save.
2. Verify Your SSH Key is Loaded
Ensure that your SSH key is loaded into your SSH agent:

sh
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
You should see a message like "Identity added: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519".

3. Test Your SSH Connection
To confirm that your SSH setup is working correctly, run:

sh
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

4. Update Your Git Remote URL (if needed)
Make sure your Git remote URL uses SSH. Check your current remote URL:

sh
Copy code
git remote -v
If it’s not using SSH, update it:

sh
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:anonanon-dev/teasty.git
Replace anonanon-dev/teasty with your actual repository path if it's different.

5. Push Your Changes
Now, try pushing your changes again:

sh
Copy code
git push origin main
Replace main with your branch name if necessary.

6. Additional Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues, double-check the following:

Permissions: Ensure that you have push access to the repository.
Correct Key: Make sure you’re using the right SSH key if you have multiple.
GitHub Status: Occasionally, there might be issues with GitHub's services. You can check GitHub Status for any ongoing issues.
If you run into any specific errors or have more questions, feel free to ask!
